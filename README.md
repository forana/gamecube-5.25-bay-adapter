# 5.25" Bay Adapter for Gamecube Controller Adapter... Adapter

This is a 3D model of a bracket adapter to mount a [Mayflash Wii U/PC USB Gamecube Controller Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-GameCube-Controller-Adapter-Switch/dp/B00RSXRLUE)'s internals inside a standard 5.25" drive bay slot. Because, y'know, why not.

This was inspired by [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1948219](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1948219), which uses the official adapter instead of this offbrand one. I did print that and get it installed, but the official adapter requires some _nasty_ driver manipulation to get working properly - this one just works.

See [gamecube-5.25-bay.stl](gamecube-5.25-bay.stl) in this repo for a 3D preview.
